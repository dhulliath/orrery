Yes I know my commenting and documentation leaves a lot to be desired. Here's some repos, and the source code. It's definitely overengineered since I don't use half the properties I've set in AstroAddress. Not even all of the constructor options either.

....Isn't it weird how much of the work goes into generating a pretty image, when the real meat of a natal chart is the text that it throws at you? Tells you a lot about my priorities.
